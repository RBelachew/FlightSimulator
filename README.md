        Our app deals with: Flight investigation

We will build an app that will allow us to view flight data on a dedicated simulator and explore them.
Our users are flight researchers or pilots who want to view data, sampled at a certain rate during a flight. 
The flight data includes the steering mode, speed, altitude direction, etc., and are recorded into a text file, which can be loaded in our app. 
The app will play the data like a movie from the beginning of the recording until the end,
it will graphically display the plane in relation to the earth, the rudder position, 
and additional flight data in a number of different views, including a view designed to find anomalies in the data.

        Pictures of the app for illustration:

        Installations are required from any developer who wants to work on your project:
In order to run our application, you need to download the FlightGear application - there is a link https://www.flightgear.org/download/ .
In addition, you need to up the .Net Framework version 4.6.1  - there is a link https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework .
